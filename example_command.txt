# Parallel or SGE scheduling of SPM scripts


## Example:

Test if parallel is installed:

```
parallel -j8 sh test_par.sh script.m :::: subject_list.txt
```

To submit an actual matlab script (remember to change the paths in all scripts!):


```
parallel -j8 sh test_par.sh batch_realign_coreg_smooth.m :::: subject_list.txt
```
